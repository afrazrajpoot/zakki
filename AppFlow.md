
Here's an improved version of the application flow for your web app, which organizes the user journey clearly:

Application Flow
Landing Page (Home Page):

1) The user visits the homepage of the website.
On the homepage, the user sees a list of available "spot" areas (multiple user spots).
If the user is interested in owning a spot, they can click the "Own a Spot" button.
Registration Page:

2) Clicking the "Own a Spot" button takes the user to a registration page.
On this page, the user must fill in the necessary registration details to create an account (e.g., name, email, etc.).
Once the registration is complete, the user can proceed to the next step.
Spot Selection:

3)After registering, the user is directed to a page where they can select one or more spots.
The user can choose as many spots as they desire.
Once spots are selected, the user clicks the "Purchase" button to move forward.
Payment Process:

4)After clicking "Purchase", the user is taken to the payment section.
Here, they will be given the wallet address (in cryptocurrency) to make the payment.
The user copies the wallet address and sends the required payment to the provided address.

5) Payment Confirmation:
Once the transaction is successfully confirmed on the blockchain, .
The user will be asked to paste the wallet address they used to make the payment and click "Done".
This helps to verify the payment.

7)Super Admin Approval:
Once the payment is confirmed, the Super Admin reviews and approves the user’s spot request.
The Super Admin has the authority to approve or reject the request based on the payment and transaction verification.

8)Profile Customization:
After the spot is approved, the user can modify their profile:
Upload an image to personalize their spot.
Add up to 3 social media links (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram).

9)Social Media Integration:
When another user hovers over the profile image of this spot owner, the 3 social media links will be displayed.
This feature helps users connect with the spot owner directly via their social media accounts.
